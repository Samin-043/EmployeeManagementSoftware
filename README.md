# EmployeeManagementSystem

Here is my first javascript project. In this project, I try to implement Employee Management Software application where HR management can add an employee, delete employee data if an employee left from the office, and update his data. Job context and payroll these types of features are also implemented here. Job context gives total employee jobs, required employees, etc. Payroll is the process of employee payment.

Tools and Technologies: HTML,CSS,Javascript.
